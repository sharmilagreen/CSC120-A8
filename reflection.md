Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

In House, I overloaded the constructors, so that a house could be specified, but could also have a default no elevator and no diningroom, or have a default number of floors (3).

In Cafe, I overloaded a constructor so that a cafe could have a default first floor only, and also overloaded the sell coffee so you could buy multiple cups of coffee at once.

In Library, I overloaded the constructors so a library could be made with a default elevator, and/or a default four floors.

This was also a very straightforward assignment for me, but I would advise anyone to do javadoc comments as they go instead of trying to do them all at once.
